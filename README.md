# **KPMG-AU-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship-Tableau**

# **Overview:**
The KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship is crafted to simulate a real-world data analytics project. Participants engage in a fictional client project, analyzing data to provide insights that drive business decisions. The internship offers a comprehensive learning journey covering data analytics aspects such as data quality assessment, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, data visualization, and presentation of findings. The main goal of this project is to advise a client on customer targeting and I practiced assessing data quality, garnering insights, and creating dashboards in a real-world context.

# **Project Objectives:**

* Gaining practical experience in data analysis and visualization.
* Applying data cleaning and preparation techniques to ensure data quality.
* Utilizing data analytics tools and techniques for exploratory data analysis.
* Developing meaningful visualizations and dashboards to effectively communicate insights.
* Providing actionable recommendations based on data analysis to address client business challenges.

# **Repository Organization:**

- **Data Quality Assessment:** This section includes the dataset, cleaned data in .csv format with code and documentation, merged csv file for data analysis, and solutions for the first task in both .docx and .pdf formats.
- **Data Insights:** This section comprises the template for task 2, the solution in .pptx format, and the 'data analysis' file for interpretation and charts.
- **Data Insights and Presentation:** This section features visualizations and dashboards created during the internship in .twbx format with Tableau, along with xlsx files of current and target customers for data analysis.
- **Certificate of Completion:** This contains the certificate of completion from KPMG AU and Forage.

# **Tasks and Solutions:**
Throughout the virtual internship, I completed tasks, implementing data analysis and visualization techniques. Each task is documented in Jupyter Notebooks within the first two directories. The visualizations and dashboards generated during the internship can be found in the 3. Data Insights and Presentation/ directory.

Feel free to navigate through the notebooks and visualizations to understand the workflow and glean insights derived from the data.

This internship has proven to be an invaluable learning experience, enabling me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, real-world project.
